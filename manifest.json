  "description": "The 999 Call Simulator is a voice-interactive educational tool designed to bridge the gap between First Aid theory and real-world application. It simulates a high-pressure emergency call, forcing the user to verbally communicate with an AI operator. Unlike standard multiple-choice quizzes, this simulator requires the user to speak clearly, answer specific triage questions, and react to changing medical situations in real-time. It is designed to practice the Primary Survey (DR ABC), Secondary Survey (S.A.M.P.L.E / AVPU), and specific Outdoor First Aid protocols.\n\nFeature Summary\n\nCore Interaction\nUniversal Emergency dialing: The simulation begins with a realistic keypad that accepts major international emergency numbers (999, 112, 911, 000, etc.) to initiate the call.\nVoice Recognition & Text-to-Speech: The app listens to the user's spoken answers and responds verbally using distinct voices for the \"Switchboard Operator\" and the \"Ambulance/Police Dispatcher.\"\nFallback Text Input: Includes a manual text entry box for users in noisy environments or devices without microphone support.\n\nAdvanced Triage Logic (The Script)\nPrimary Survey Enforcement: Prioritizes critical checks immediately: Breathing, Consciousness, Location.\nAVPU Responsiveness Scale: If the casualty is awake, the operator drills down to check if they are Alert or responding to Voice. If they fail these checks, they are marked \"Unresponsive.\"\nSmart S.A.M.P.L.E. History: Conducts a secondary survey (Signs, Allergies, Medications, Past History, Last Oral Intake, Events).\nSmart Logic: If the patient is marked \"Unresponsive,\" the simulator intelligently skips questions the patient cannot answer (e.g., \"What did you last eat?\").\nAssociative Keyword Recognition: The AI links context clues to medical issues (e.g., \"Tree/Ladder\" triggers Spinal protocol; \"River/Snow\" triggers Hypothermia protocol; \"Peanuts/Sting\" triggers Anaphylaxis protocol).\n\nMedical Protocols\nCardiac Arrest (CPR Mode): Recognizes \"not breathing\" or \"agonal gasps.\" Activates a 120 BPM Audio Metronome to pace chest compressions. Provides an Encouragement Loop every 60 seconds (e.g., \"You are keeping them alive, don't stop\").\nDiabetes: Detects keywords like \"insulin\" or \"sugar,\" checks for confusion/hypoglycemia, and advises on glucose administration only if the patient is alert.\nAnaphylaxis: Differentiates between mild reactions and severe breathing difficulties; advises on Adrenaline Auto-Injectors (EpiPen).\nTrauma & Bleeding: Distinguishes between catastrophic (spurting) bleeding and standard wounds, advising on direct pressure, elevation, or tourniquets.\nEnvironmental (Outdoor First Aid): Hypothermia: Advises on shelter, insulation from the ground, and warm drinks. Hyperthermia: Advises on shade, cooling, and hydration.\n\nDynamic \"Real-World\" Elements\nDynamic ETA Generation: Calculates arrival time based on Location (Urban vs. Remote/Hills) and Severity. Example: A cardiac arrest in a city might get an 8-minute ETA, while a broken ankle on a mountain gets 120+ minutes.\nPriority Upgrading: If the patient’s condition deteriorates (e.g., they stop breathing during the call), the operator \"upgrades\" the call to Category 1 and provides a new, faster ETA.\nAuto-Announcements: Seamlessly weaves reassurance (\"Help has been arranged...\") into the conversation between questions.\n\n\"Monitor Mode\" (Post-Call Support)\nThe simulator does not end after the questions are answered. It enters a \"Monitor Loop\" where the operator stays on the line. Reacts to Changes: The user can say \"They are going to be sick\" (triggers Airway advice) or \"They stopped breathing\" (triggers CPR protocol). Time Checks: The user can ask \"How much longer?\" anytime to hear the remaining ETA.",
